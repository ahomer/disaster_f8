models/train_classifier.py -- Train a multiple classifier model <br>
data/process_data.py       -- Load and clean data


### Instructions
1. Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up your database and model.

    - To run ETL pipeline that cleans data and stores in database

    - To run ML pipeline that trains classifier and saves

        `python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/classifier.pkl`

2. Run the following command in the app's directory to run your web app.

    `python run.py`

3. Go to http://0.0.0.0:3001/
